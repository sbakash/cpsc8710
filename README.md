## Authors 👨‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻
This Snake and Ladder game was developed by Akash Shanmugam Boobalan, Jagathi Kota, and Vinay Kumar Reddy Vallapu Reddy as a part of a web-based application project for the course Foundations of Software Engineering (CPSC 8710).

## Design and Development Process 🎨🛠️
The "Snakes and Ladders" web game required numerous essential considerations throughout the design and production process. First, we created a user interface that was both visually appealing and responsive, placing components like the dice, player pieces, and game board with care. Although there were difficulties in putting the fundamental game logic into practice, we could control player motions, ladder, and snake confrontations, and declare the winner. The player information, including names and animal image pieces, was efficiently saved and updated throughout gameplay. To guarantee user participation, we included entertaining features like an animation of dice rolling and enabled rolling of dice upon user clicks. Even if the user experience and code structure may use some work, the project demonstrated how crucial planning and constant improvement are to producing a playable and visually appealing web game.

### Challenges Faced 🚧
It was challenging to develop the movement of the pieces and the placement of the board, which required extensive changes and debugging. The animation was complex and required synchronization and quick user input, particularly for the dice rolls. In addition, it took a lot of work to precisely coordinate the motions of the player pieces throughout the board to ensure that they advanced the correct number of steps and handled the ladder and snake positions effectively. Working on the above mentioned resulted in a good gameplay experience.

### What Worked ✅
The fundamental mechanics of the game—piece movement, and encounters with ladders and snakes—all functioned well, dice rolling, guaranteeing a pleasant gaming experience. Player information was efficiently organized, and parts were differentiated with animal characters. Additionally, by enabling users to create random numbers by simply clicking the dice or roll button, the dice rolling motion added interaction and increased user engagement. The gameplay gained an audio dimension with the addition of sound effects, which enhanced the immersive experience of the game.

### What Didn't ❌
It is necessary to improve the CSS positioning of game elements, such as the dice, player pieces, and board, particularly when adjusting to different screen sizes. It is imperative to improve the user experience, which calls for improved transitions, a more refined interface, and more precise instructions.

### Lessons Learned 🧐
The development process taught us how important it is to plan and design everything carefully because understanding the game's rules and how users interact with it is essential. Thorough testing and debugging are essential for finding and fixing problems, leading to a more efficient and successful game development process, particularly for intricate logic and animations. A well-structured layout, visually appealing components, and clear, concise instructions can all greatly enhance the player's experience and increase the game's accessibility and engagement. In conclusion, there were obstacles to overcome in the areas of responsive design, user interface, and game logic during the design and development of the "Snakes and Ladders" game. Even though the essential features operate as intended, the user interface, code organization, and visual design could all use some work. This project emphasizes how crucial planning, responsive design, and continuous improvement are to producing an engaging and easy-to-use web game.
